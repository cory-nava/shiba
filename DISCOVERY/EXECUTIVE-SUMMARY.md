# Executive Summary - SHIBA Multi-State Transformation

## Project Vision

Transform SHIBA (State Hosted Integrated Benefits Application) from a Minnesota-specific benefits application into a **configurable, cloud-agnostic, open-source platform** that any state can deploy for their Income & Expense (IE&E) benefits programs.

---

## Current State Assessment

### What SHIBA Is Today

SHIBA is a production-ready Spring Boot web application enabling Minnesota residents to apply for state benefits (SNAP, CCAP, CASH, GRH, EA, CERTAIN_POPS). It's well-architected with:

‚úÖ **Strong Foundation**
- Event-driven architecture
- Encrypted JSONB data storage
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, a11y)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Multi-instance capable (JDBC session store)

### Key Constraints

‚ùå **Minnesota-Specific Hardcoding**
- 87 counties (Java enum)
- 11 tribal nations (Java enum)
- MNIT FileNet SOAP integration
- 6 program definitions
- Admin email addresses
- Time zone (America/Chicago)
- Email domain (mail.mnbenefits.mn.gov)

‚ùå **Cloud Dependency**
- Azure Blob Storage (hardcoded)
- Not portable to AWS, GCP, or on-premises

---

## Transformation Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Multi-State Capability**
   - Any state can deploy with their own counties/regions
   - Configurable programs and document types
   - State-specific business rules

2. **Cloud Agnostic**
   - Support AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises
   - Abstracted storage (S3, Blob, GCS, MinIO, local)
   - Database provider flexibility (PostgreSQL on any cloud)

3. **Integration Flexibility**
   - Plugin architecture for document submission
   - Support SOAP, REST, SFTP, and email
   - State-specific adapters as needed

4. **Reduced Deployment Time**
   - From months ‚Üí weeks for new states
   - Self-service configuration via admin UI
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples

5. **Open Source**
   - Public repository with clear governance
   - Active community support
   - State-contributed adapters and features

## Recommended Approach

### 8-Phase Implementation Plan

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------|----------|------------------|
| **1** | Extract MN-specific logic | 4-6 weeks | Configuration service, regions YAML |
| **2** | Integration adapters | 6-8 weeks | SOAP, REST, SFTP, email adapters |
| **3** | Database multi-tenancy | 3-4 weeks | Tenant tables, MN migration |
| **4** | Pilot state deployment | 6-8 weeks | Second state live in production |
| **5** | Business rules engine | 4-6 weeks | Externalized eligibility rules |
| **6** | Admin UI | 10-12 weeks | Self-service configuration portal |
| **7** | Documentation | 4-6 weeks | Setup guides, API docs, examples |
| **8** | Testing (ongoing) | Continuous | Multi-tenant test suite |

**Total Timeline:** 6-8 months with parallel work streams

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Start Small: Proof of Concept (Week 1-4)**
   - Extract County enum to configuration
   - Validate approach with minimal risk
   - Fast feedback before major investment

2. **Pilot State Selection (Month 3-4)**
   - Choose small/medium state
   - Simpler integration (email or SFTP, not complex SOAP)
   - Real-world validation before scaling

3. **Cloud Abstraction Early (Month 2)**
   - Storage abstraction in Phase 2
   - Enables states to choose their cloud
   - De-risks cloud lock-in

4. **Minnesota Backwards Compatibility**
   - Zero disruption to current users
   - Comprehensive regression testing
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Minnesota breaks during refactoring** | Critical | Comprehensive regression tests, feature flags, frequent staging validation |
| **Pilot state integration issues** | High | Choose state with simple integration (email/SFTP), build SFTP adapter early |
| **Other states have unique requirements** | Medium | Flexible config (JSONB), plugin architecture, good documentation |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Performance with multi-tenancy** | Medium | Configuration caching, query optimization, load testing |
| **States can't self-configure** | Medium | Admin UI, excellent docs, onboarding support |
| **Timeline slips** | Medium | Phased approach, MVP focus, parallel work streams |

### Low Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Cloud provider compatibility** | Low | Abstraction layer, test on multiple clouds |
| **Open source governance** | Low | Clear contribution guidelines, steering committee |

## Why This Matters

### The Problem

States spend **$500K-2M+ and 6-18 months** building custom benefits applications. Many states still rely on outdated, inaccessible systems that frustrate applicants and staff.

### The Opportunity

A modern, open-source, configurable platform could:
- Help **50 states** modernize their benefits systems
- Reach **millions of residents** applying for benefits
- Save **hundreds of millions** in taxpayer dollars
- Improve **application completion rates** by 10-30%

### The SHIBA Advantage

SHIBA is already **production-proven** in Minnesota with:
- Thousands of applications processed
- High accessibility standards
- Modern tech stack
- Active maintenance and support

**We're 70% there.** This transformation makes it reusable for all states.

---

## Conclusion

SHIBA has a **solid foundation** and is **production-ready**. The transformation to multi-state, cloud-agnostic is:

‚úÖ **Achievable** - Clear path with 8 phases
‚úÖ **De-risked** - POC first, pilot before scale
‚úÖ **Cost-effective** - $525-675K over 12 months
‚úÖ **High-impact** - Enable 50 states to modernize
‚úÖ **Incremental** - Minnesota keeps working throughout

### Recommended Decision

‚úÖ **Approve** Phase 1 POC (4-6 weeks, ~$50K)
- Low risk, high learning
- Validates entire approach
- Easy go/no-go decision point

If POC succeeds ‚Üí Approve full project.
If POC struggles ‚Üí Minimal investment, early learning.
